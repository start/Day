/*
  This represents a line of code that's been lightly processed.

  Its indent level is calculated, its whitespace and commentary
  are removed, and the remaining pieces of code are collected as
  tokens.

  Given this line of code:
    "DotProduct (Vector2D, Vector2D) -> Vector2D"

  Here's the representation:
    .tokens =
    {
      "DotProduct", "(Vector2D,", "Vector2D)", "->", "Vector2D"
    },
    .tokens_s = 5,
    .indent_level = 0

  Given this line of code:
    "    return vectorçš„x"

  Here's the representation:
    .tokens =
    {
      "return", "vector", "x"
    },
    .tokens_s = 3,
    .indent_level = 2
