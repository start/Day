    This field represents how many levels deep this line is

    To indent code by 1 level, we can use either:

    * 2 regular spaces
    * 1 fullwidth space (https://unicode-explorer.com/c/3000)
    * 1 tab

    Now, imagine an indent of 3 regular spaces. That lies between
    indent levels of 1 and 2, so which indent level should Day
    use? During this preliminary stage of processing, we'll just
    record the indent level as 1.5.

    However, ultimately, indent levels need to be whole numbers!
    A later stage of processing will be able to reject this line
    and offer a helpful error message.
