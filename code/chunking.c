    This field represents how many levels deep this line is indented.
    So Why is this field a floating point number?

    To indent code by 1 level, we can use either:

    * 2 regular spaces
    * 1 fullwidth space (https://unicode-explorer.com/c/3000)
    * 1 tab

    Okay, but what happens if someone idents a line using an odd
    number of regular spaces?

    For example, imagine an indent of 3 regular spaces. That lies
    between indent levels of 1 and 2, so which indent level
    should we choose?

    During this preliminary stage of processing, we'll just
    record the indent level as 1.5.

    However, ultimately, indent levels need to be whole numbers!
    A later stage of processing will be able to reject this line
    and offer a helpful error message.
